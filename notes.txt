Possible errors to account / check for:
1. we use the ta->nodeType incorrectly and are calling / asking for a type instead of creating it
    i. Identify where we are going to be adding a type to the hashmap and when were going to be
       reading from it.
2. setcurrentfntype and getcurrnentfntype -- where is that going to be used?
